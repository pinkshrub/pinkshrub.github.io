# Project Week

Woooo! Project Week! Project week is an exciting time at the dojo. After weeks of hard work learning new technologies and working through assignments, project week presents an opportunity to grow and learn in a different way. You can look to gain a deeper understanding of the frameworks and languages you've been working with, explore new technologies that excite you, prepare for your portfolio, work with other students accross stacks, or tidy up your skills for exam retakes and black belts. So, whether you are retaking or project-ing, this week has a lot to offer, but you have to be ready to adjust to what you are doing each day. Keep reading for an overview of what is going on during this week and some strategies and resources to be successful.
