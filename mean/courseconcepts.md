Python is going to be a little crazy. Jk! It's gonna be a lotta crazy. Please, don't think it is "just you"! I want to talk a little bit about the sheer quantity of information that is going to be coming your way over the next few weeks, and in particular this first week and a half. Before we dive into it too much, here is a brief overview of the course at a day-to-day level:

Week1 - Introduction to python, programming, and the internet
    - Monday: Introduction to Python
    - Tuesday: Introduction to OOP in Python
    - Wednesday: Flask: OOP on the web
    - Thursday: DataBases 101
    - Friday: Using OOP to connect the internet to data
Week2 - Introduction to Django, the do-it-all framework
    - Monday: Have you finished building reddit yet?
    - Tuesday: Intro to django, Views + Controllers
    - Wednesday: Django, moving data around
    - Thursday: What is an ORM?
    - Friday: Django: Models
Week3 - Finer points of django, deployment, and BLACK BELT EXAM #1
    - Monday:  Finer points of Django
    - Tuesday: Django workflow + Review
    - Wednesday: Deployment
    - Thursday: Preparation
    - Friday: Black Belt, Project Week Lecture
Week4 - Project Week & Belt Exam retakes
    - Monday: Exam Review & Project Work
    - Tuesday: Exam Retakes & Project Work
    - Wednesday: Exam Review & Project Work & Alexa Hackathon
    - Thursday: Exam Retakes & Project Work
    - Friday: Presentations & Graduation & Exam Retakes

What I'd like to point out is that the diversity of topics is highest in week 1 and slows down once we hit week 2. This is because we want to develop fluency on django for the blackbelt exam. To do this we are going to use a variety of tools to introduce concepts of Full Stack Web Development. We are going to use tools that are designed to be used with the python programming language, which values _readability_. This means we can focus more on how to use our tools to explore these concepts. As you become more experienced building and breaking and fixing, your knowledge of python as a language and tool itself will also deepen.

But it is still a loooot of different things, so what is really important is that you ask questions when you don't understand why something is happening, but also be okay accepting some form of "it isn't directly relevant to making us better *right now*" or "this is how we are going to do it _this_ time ;)" when it doesn't directly influence _how_ we use some of these tools or is part of a larger idea. Also, you have to be willing to put in some time getting reps in. There are a lot of assignments but group up and work on them together to move through them faster. The 20 minute rule is your friend! 

Week 2 will just be about combining everything we did in week 1 into a single Web Development Framework called django and learning about its different parts. This will be our exploration into what "MVC" is and how django implements it. We will look at moving data around, modularizing apps, interacting with dbs through an orm, and using models to work with data. Finally we will look at some neat built in tools django has to speed up development and look at deploying our applications on the cloud. 

And then we take our Exam. SO WE CAN DO PROJECTS AND AWESOME THINGS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

But for reals, you really should try your best to earn an 8.0 and a red belt on the exam at the end of week 3. This program is intense, and you will have done a lot of similar things preparing for this exam. Project week is a time for you to develop skills that will be relevant in the workforce. In addition to working on things such as teamwork, version control, and design projects give you the opportunity to explore new technologies and platforms using python and flask and django web frameworks and SQL databases. Python is a very popular language and a lot of fun libraries exist that you can use and work with to make a wide variety of projects. Project week also comes with a theme that you can integrate into your project to earn a green belt sticker.

If you don't earn a red belt on your first try, that is okay! Correct your exam over the weekend. Come up with a project idea and on monday, correct your exam up to a passing grade and work on your project. On Tuesday and Thursday, we'll do exam retakes. On Wednesday, for those that don't have an appropriate scale project or just passed their exams, we will do an Alexa Hackathon! For stickers and stuff. Friday will be Project Presentations and Graduation! Pretty fun stuff!

Lastly, a note on algorithms! Week 1 of python is a crucial week of algorithms, it gives me more time to talk about OOP which will be mega useful given how integral it is and how frequently I will reference it over the month. We will move into stacks and queues, our first _Abstract Data Structures_ and a great opportunity to explore OOP. After having introduced ourselves to some basic data structures, we will then work on some algorithms to broaden how we work with arrays and linked lists. Algorithms are realyl important! Seriously! They will help you learn where your application is breaking down. That is really helpful! And you will learn concepts that can reinforce your understanding of programmin across all languages.
